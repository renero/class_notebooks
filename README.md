# PyDataset

Allows a simpler representation of the dataset used to build a model in class. It allows to load a remote CSV by providing an URL to the initialization method of the object, and work on the most common tasks related to data preparation and feature engineering.

To read more about the API, please refer to the [API Documentation Home](https://pydataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The class `Dataset` still needs more work, but feel free to contribute and experiment with it via pull request.

If you want to use it, I recommend to install via pip with a link to the source, in case you want to update or pull it regularly:

    $ git clone https://github.com/renero/dataset
    $ cd dataset
    $ pip install -e .
